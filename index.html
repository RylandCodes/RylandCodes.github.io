        <h2>Introduction to Semakau Landfill</h2>
        <p>
          Semakau Landfill is Singapore’s only landfill, located on an island
          south of the mainland. Despite being a landfill, the site has been
          designed to be environmentally friendly, helping to preserve the
          surrounding marine life. However, with the growing volume of waste,
          environmental issues related to the landfill are becoming increasingly
          pressing.

        <h2>Why is Semakau Filling Up?</h2>

        <p>
          Singaporeans produce around 2,000 tonnes of waste daily, most of which
          ends up in Semakau Landfill. Despite this, only about 12% of
          households actually recycle, which is the lowest rate in a decade. Even among
          recyclables, much of the waste remains unrecyclable due to
          contamination. Many Singaporeans mistakenly dispose of non-recyclable
          items or fail to clean their recyclables, rendering entire batches
          unusable. Living in a clean environment, many do not see recycling as
          a priority. For example, some discard plastic items without rinsing
          them or leave food inside containers, contaminating the materials and
          reducing their chances of being successfully recycled.
        </p>

        <p>
          Increased consumption in Singapore leads to more waste being
          generated. In contrast, Sweden is an example of a highly efficient
          recycler, with a domestic recycling rate of over 99%, compared to
          Singapore’s mere 12%.

        <h2>What Happens If Semakau Fills Up</h2>

        <p>
          If Semakau Landfill reaches capacity, it will pose a challenge for
          land-scarce Singapore. Expanding landfills would reduce space for
          housing, infrastructure, and green areas, worsening the country’s
          space constraints.
        </p>

        <p>
          Additionally, a landfill on mainland Singapore would cause
          environmental issues, including pollution from methane gas and
          leachate, which could contaminate groundwater. This would harm local
          ecosystems and contribute to climate change.
        </p>

        <p>
          Pollution also poses health risks, as poor air quality and
          contaminated water sources can lead to respiratory issues and other
          diseases.
        </p>

        <p>
          Overall, a landfill on mainland Singapore would harm the environment,
          reduce residents’ quality of life, and hinder the country’s progress
          in waste management.

        <h2>Solutions YOU can do to Prevent a Waste Crisis</h2>

        <p>
          There are small steps we can take to address this issue. In Sweden,
          over 99% of household waste is recycled or reused. The country’s
          system holds producers responsible for recycling or disposing of their
          products, including packaging, electronics, and batteries. This
          approach has led to a high recycling rate. By following Sweden’s
          example, we can improve recycling rates and extend Semakau Landfill’s
          lifespan.
        </p>

        <h2>Some cool ideas you can implement</h2>
        <h3>Use reusable bags, bottles, and containers</h3>
        <p>
          Using reusable alternatives to single-use plastics is one of the
          simplest and most effective ways to reduce waste. Plastic bags,
          bottles, and containers are often used only once before being
          discarded, contributing to pollution and landfill waste. By switching
          to reusable versions, you can drastically reduce the number of plastic
          items you use.
        </p>
        <h3>Go paperless</h3>
        <p>
          Opting for paperless options is a great way to reduce waste and save
          trees. From digital banking to online documents and notes, moving away
          from paper-based systems reduces the demand for paper production,
          which in turn reduces deforestation and energy consumption.
        </p>
        <h3>Choose sustainable packaging</h3>
        <p>
          Sustainable packaging options help reduce the environmental impact of
          products. By choosing items that use minimal or recyclable packaging,
          you can make a difference in reducing waste, as packaging often makes
          up a large percentage of the waste stream.
        </p>

        <h2>Looking Forward</h2>
        <p>
          Singapore aims to reduce daily waste sent to Semakau Landfill by 30%
          by 2030. Singaporeans can help delay its filling by recycling and
          reducing unnecessary purchases. By making these changes, we can extend
          Semakau Landfill’s lifespan. We can do this!
