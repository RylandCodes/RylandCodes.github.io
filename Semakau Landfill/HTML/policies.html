        <h2>Singapore's Approach to Landfill Waste Management</h2>

        <p>
          The Singapore government has implemented several policies to address
          the growing waste problem and extend the lifespan of Semakau Landfill.
          One of the most significant initiatives is the Zero Waste Masterplan,
          which aims to reduce the amount of waste sent to landfills by 30% by
          2030. This policy encourages waste reduction, reuse, and recycling,
          shifting towards a circular economy.
        </p>

        <p>
          In addition, the government has introduced the Waste-to-Energy (WTE)
          program, which helps reduce the volume of waste sent to Semakau
          Landfill. WTE plants incinerate non-recyclable waste, converting it
          into energy. The government also promotes extended producer
          responsibility, holding manufacturers accountable for the waste
          produced by their products, and encouraging them to design with
          sustainability in mind.
        </p>

        <p>
          Lastly, Singaporeâ€™s National Environment Agency (NEA) works closely
          with industries, businesses, and the public to create a more
          sustainable waste management ecosystem. Public campaigns and
          regulations ensure that recycling is more widespread and effective,
          significantly reducing the amount of waste being sent to the landfill.
