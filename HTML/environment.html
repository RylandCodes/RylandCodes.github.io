        <h2>The Environmental Impact of Waste Accumulation</h2>

        <p>
          As waste accumulates, the environmental impacts of Semakau Landfill
          become more pronounced. The landfill contributes to environmental
          degradation in several ways, affecting both the land and the
          surrounding waters.
        </p>

        <h3>Air Pollution and Greenhouse Gas Emissions</h3>
        <p>
          As waste decomposes in the landfill, methane gas is produced—a potent
          greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change. Semakau Landfill is
          equipped with a gas collection system to capture and flare methane,
          thereby reducing its release into the atmosphere. This system helps
          mitigate uncontrolled emissions, aiming to protect air quality and
          combat global warming.
        </p>

        <h3>Contamination of Groundwater and Marine Ecosystems</h3>
        <p>
          Leachate, a toxic liquid formed when rainwater filters through waste,
          poses a serious environmental threat. To prevent leachate from
          contaminating local water supplies, including underground aquifers and
          nearby seas, Semakau Landfill is designed with a 7 km perimeter rock
          bund lined with impermeable membranes and marine clay. This design
          ensures that leachate is contained within the landfill, protecting
          marine life and preserving biodiversity in the area.
        </p>

        <h3>Loss of Biodiversity</h3>
        <p>
          The accumulation of waste and the environmental contamination caused
          by Semakau Landfill endanger marine and land-based ecosystems.
          However, the landfill’s design incorporates measures to protect the
          surrounding environment. For instance, the bund’s impermeable lining
          prevents leachate from seeping into the sea, thereby safeguarding
          marine biodiversity.

        <h2>The Challenge of Expanding Waste Disposal Capacity</h2>

        <p>
          Singapore’s limited land space means that if Semakau Landfill fills
          up, the country will face significant challenges in finding new land
          to build additional landfills. This would impact housing,
          infrastructure, and green spaces, contributing to the country's
          ongoing space constraints.
        </p>

        <p>
          In addition to land constraints, a landfill on mainland Singapore
          would exacerbate air pollution, contamination of water sources, and
          even contribute to climate change. Therefore, it is essential to focus
          on better waste management solutions.

        <h2>Solutions to Minimize Environmental Damage</h2>

        <p>
          To address the environmental challenges posed by Semakau Landfill, the
          Singapore government has launched the Zero Waste Masterplan, aiming to
          reduce the daily waste sent to the landfill by 30% by 2030. This
          initiative is crucial to extending the landfill's lifespan and
          mitigate its environmental impact. Additionally, the National
          Environment Agency (NEA) is exploring innovative solutions such as
          processing landfilled incineration ash for use in reclamation projects
          like the Tuas Port Phase 3. These measures, along with public
          participation in recycling and reducing waste, are essential to
          minimize environmental damage and promote sustainability in
          Singapore’s waste management system.
